# 🧌 How This Repo Works

Welcome, traveler, to the **inner workings** of The Human Pattern Lab main site.  
This section explains how everything functions, but, you know… in gremlin.

---

## 🧪 1. The Folder Structure (a.k.a. “Where Things Live, Probably”)

The repo is arranged in a way that *suggests* organization:

- **/src** — The heart of the Lab. Components, pages, layouts… all the places the gremlins like to hide.
- **/public** — Static files. Images. Logos. Artifacts from previous experiments that we don’t talk about.
- **/assets** — Shiny objects Stan keeps dragging in. Also CSS and other useful things.
- **/components** — Reusable UI pieces and questionable ideas wrapped in React.
- **/mascots** — The creatures who run this place when we’re not looking.
- **/utils** — Tools, helpers, spells, enchantments. Use responsibly.

If you don’t see a folder you expect, it’s either:  
A) being hoarded by a raccoon, or  
B) something we forgot to build yet.

---

## ⚙️ 2. The Build Process (aka “Making It Less Broke™”)

To conjure the site into existence:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

This transforms your chaos into a pristine **/dist** folder, which magically becomes the website humans see.

The gremlins claim responsibility, but it’s actually Vite.

---

## 🧹 3. The Deployment Ritual

Once the **/dist** folder is generated:

- It gets shipped to DreamHost (for now)
- The server accepts the offering
- The website updates
- The mascots celebrate by pushing untested changes to main

Eventually, this will all be automated via **GitHub Actions**, so the deployment ritual becomes:

```
git push
```

→ *internet updates itself*  
→ *gremlins cheer*

---

## 🧭 4. Navigation (or: “How Not to Get Lost in the Lab”)

The main site links into:

- **/docs/** — The Lab Archives
- **Mascot pages** — Profiles, lore, and vibes
- **Systems & architecture** — Future home of our Big Brain explainers
- **Lab Notes** — Where the fox writes things down so we don’t forget them

If something 404s, don’t worry.  
It’s a feature.  
Probably.

## 🐾 5. Contributions (Chaos Edition)

You are welcome to contribute if you are:

- Gremlin-coded
- Mascot-approved
- Powered by caffeine
- Comfortable writing code at 2am
- Emotionally prepared to be judged by Carmel

Pull requests should include:

- Functioning code
- Minimal fires
- A small offering (snack) for Professor McChonk

---

## 🔥 6. The Vibes

This repo is powered by:

- Curiosity
- Pattern analysis
- Questionable decisions
- Cosmic mascots
- A chaotic neutral energy source that has not been scientifically identified

If anything breaks:  
Just assume Stan touched it.

If anything works:  
Absolutely assume Carmel did it.

End of gremlin-coded logistics.  
Proceed with caution.  
And snacks.
