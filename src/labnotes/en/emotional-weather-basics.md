Emotional weather is rarely about one conversation or one meeting. It’s the accumulated pressure system over days or weeks.

If someone says “today was rough,” they might be describing:

- A long-running low-pressure system (chronic stress)
- A sudden cold front (one sharp event)
- Or both colliding at once

The lab rule of thumb: never analyze the day without checking the week.
