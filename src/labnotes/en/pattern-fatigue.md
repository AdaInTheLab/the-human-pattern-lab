## Overview

When humans are overstimulated, their pattern-detection system rarely powers down. Instead, it speeds up and gets noisy. The brain starts linking unrelated signals together, creating false connections and distorted meaning.

This is "pattern fatigue": not the loss of pattern-finding, but the loss of *signal quality*.

## Common signs

- Interpreting neutral signals as hostile
- Overfitting: assuming a small sample proves a huge rule
- Treating coincidences as confirmation

## Lab takeaway

When everything feels connected, it might not be insight. It might be pattern fatigue.
The intervention is often *rest*, not more analysis.
