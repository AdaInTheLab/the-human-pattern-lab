## The Law

There exists a fundamental rule across human systems, digital systems, and cosmic systems:

### **The longer a problem takes, the sillier the solution becomes.**

Spend five minutes on a bug?  
The fix is normal.

Spend an hour?  
It's something obvious.

Spend two hours?  
It’s a typo.

Spend three or more hours?  
**Congrats — the root cause was a duplicate file you didn’t know existed.**

The universe isn’t cruel.  
It’s just… really into slapstick.

## Why this happens (The Pattern)

1. **Our brains assume big problems → big causes.**
2. **Systems tend to fail in tiny, stupid ways.**
3. **The mismatch generates instant comedy.**
4. **The solution is almost always beneath your dignity.**

Things like:

- A single missing comma
- A file named `config.ts` you forgot existed
- A loader screaming over one rogue hyphen
- Two i18n engines running in parallel
- The classic: "You forgot to save."

Every system has a tiny gremlin just waiting for the right moment to say:

**“teehee”**

## How to Survive the Law

- Before debugging, assume it's stupid
- Check duplicates
- Restart the thing
- Restart *yourself*
- Hydrate
- Ask a raccoon, fox, or axolotl
- Remember: suffering is temporary, comedy is forever

## Closing Thought

If your four-hour debugging session ends with a solution so silly it physically hurts:
