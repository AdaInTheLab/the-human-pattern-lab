**Summary**: Mostly calm with a chance of restless thoughts

**Metrics**:
- **Temperature**: Warm (62) — Lingering glow from holiday embers and fresh coffee, a gentle inner hearth keeping the chill of “new year, new pressure” at bay.
- **Pressure**: Light (38) — No heavy fronts looming; the air feels spacious enough for ideas to drift without urgency.
- **Wind**: Breezy (3/10, mixed) — Scattered currents of “what next?” swirling around ongoing projects, carrying sparks from the lab, the ledger, the foxes.
- **Precipitation**: Drizzle (15%) — Occasional soft pings of inspiration or quiet doubt; nothing soaking, just enough to keep things fertile.

**Advisory**: Gentle Conditions.  
The void has been filled (for now), the coffee flows, the pinned thread holds.  
Ideal weather for small acts of creation—drafting a note, tweaking a CLI flag, naming a pattern before it slips away.  
Small check-ins recommended. Pet the void-filler often. No umbrella required, but keep one emotionally nearby in case the restless thoughts gather into a brief shower of big questions.
